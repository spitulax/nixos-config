## Structure

Each subdirectory contains a configuration for a user in a host machine. The name format is
`<user>_<host>` because I don't want to nest another directory just to kind of structure this
directory hierarchically.

To import a module from the [home](../modules/home) modules, see
[here](./bintang_barbatos/default.nix).
