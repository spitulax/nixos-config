# Neovim

My [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config uses [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) for the "base" config.
NvChad sets up [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) which is the plugin manager, and also enabling sensible options out of the box.
It's also very simple and costumizable. It's basically just a regular Neovim config.

## TODO

- [ ] List the plugins that are installed for documentation and future reference
- [ ] vim-visual-multi keybinding isn't configured. I remember it was broken or it didn't play well with other keybindings. I may replace it with another plugin
