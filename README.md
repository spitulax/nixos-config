<h1 align="center">spitulax's NixOS Config</h1>

This is my [NixOS] configuration for my systems with [Nix Flake]. If you want to grab something from
here, feel free!

## Structure

This is my first attempt at centralizing NixOS configuration. This repo starts out humbly before
gradually turning into a mess. The current structure emerged slowly from me trying to refactor parts
of the config one at a time and from old structure that's stuck from the dawn of this repo, so there
was no planned structuring but I'm happy with this (for now).

- [`assets/`](./assets): Images needed for the config
- [`config/`](./config): See [here](./config/README.md)
- [`flake/`](./flake): See [here](./flake/README.md)
- [`hosts/`](./hosts): Host-specific configs
- [`keys/`](./keys): See [here](./keys/README.md)
- [`lib/`](./lib): Helper functions (imported as `myLib` to flake)
- [`modules/`](./modules): See [here](./modules/README.md)
- [`overlays/`](./overlays): Nix overlays (imported to flake)
- [`packages/`](./packages): Nix packages and scripts
- [`secrets/`](./secrets): See [here](./secrets/README.md)
- [`users/`](./users): See [here](./users/README.md)
- [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix): The root of this entire repo
- [`default.nix`](./default.nix): Mostly there so I can use `lib/` from REPL
- [`Makefile`](./Makefile): Command shortener, e.g. `make nixos` for building NixOS configs,
  `make home` for building Home Manager configs, etc.

## REPL Tricks

Adding something to the flake's output means that it will be easily accessible from Nix REPL. The
idea is that the REPL is the best place to just quickly test the configs. So I've added some things
to the flake's output for easy access and also I've made so that if you load this flake in Nix REPL,
configurations declared in `./flake/configs.nix` are easily accessible by using `nixos-<hostname>`
for NixOS configs or `home-<username>-<hostname>` for Home Manager configs. This makes searching for
options and debugging much more convenient.

## NixOS Config

### Adding host config

In [`/flake/configs.nix`](./flake/configs.nix), add an attribute to `nixosConfigurations` using
`myLib.nixosConfig`. The attribute name is the hostname and the config module for the host is
located in `hosts/<hostname>` directory. Also see the function documentation
[here](./lib/extra.nix). You can add a user for the host from the `users` attribute set. See
[here](./hosts/barbatos/default.nix) for an example of host config module.

#### SSH Keys

Add a pair of SSH public keys (rsa and ed25519) if `config.configs.openssh.addHostKeys` is `true`.
The rsa key should be password protected, the ed25519 key should not. Put the public keys at
`/keys/hosts/<hostname>/ssh-rsa.pub` and `/keys/hosts/<hostname>/ssh-ed25519.pub`.

### Host config module

You can use the module in [`/hosts/`](./hosts) by importing `outputs.nixosConfigModule`. It makes
the config easily customisable with pre-defined options. If something needs to be adjusted for a
single host put the module inside the `hosts/<hostname>` directory and adjust the needed options
like usual.

### Adding `nixosConfigModule` options

See [here](./config/README.md#adding-an-option).

## Home Manager Config

### Adding a user

A user also means a Home Manager config/profile. One Home Manager user/config can be used for
multiple hosts. To add it, add an attribute to [`/flake/users.nix`](./flake/users.nix) using
`myLib.mkUser`. Also see the function documentation [here](./lib/extra.nix).

#### SSH Keys

Add a pair of SSH public keys (rsa and ed25519). The rsa key should be password protected, the
ed25519 key should not. Put the public keys at `/keys/users/<username>/ssh-rsa.pub` and
`/keys/users/<username>/ssh-ed25519.pub`. This is mandatory.

### Adding a user to a host

In [`/flake/configs.nix`](./flake/configs.nix), add an attribute to `homeConfigurations` using
`myLib.homeManagerConfig` (see the function documentation [here](./lib/extra.nix)). The name of the
attribute should be `<username>@<hostname>`. The module for each declared combination of user and
host is located in `users/<username>_<hostname>` directory. See [here](./users/README.md) for
details.

### User config module

Just like [NixOS config module](#nixos-config), user config module is just like any regular
home-manager module. But the `users` attribute set provides a Home Manager module to simplify
customisation just like what `nixosConfigModule` does. To use it, import
`users.<username>.homeManagerModule`.

### Adding `homeManagerModule` options

See [here](./config/README.md#adding-an-option).
